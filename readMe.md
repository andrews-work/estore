steps:

Step 1: Layout for Category Pages (e.g., Shirts, Shoes, Pants, Hats)
    Create a consistent layout for category pages (Shirts, Shoes, Pants, Hats) using React components.
    Define the structure of each category page, including headers, product listings, and navigation.
    Import the ProductTemplate.js component for displaying product listings.
Step 2: Product Component
    Create the Product.js component for displaying detailed product information.
    Design the layout for the individual product pages, including images, descriptions, prices, and specifications.
Step 3: Backend Integration
    Set up your Node.js server to handle API requests.
    Create API routes for fetching all products and individual product details.
    Use the MySQL library to connect to your database and fetch data.
    Ensure that the server returns data in JSON format.
Step 4: Fetching and Rendering Data
    In the category pages (Shirts, Shoes, Pants, Hats), fetch product data from the backend API using Axios or a similar library.
    Display the fetched data by mapping it to the ProductTemplate component.
Step 5: Navigation and Links
    Implement navigation between category pages and individual product pages using React Router.
    Create links or buttons that allow users to click through and view individual product details.
Step 6: Testing and Debugging
    Test your application to ensure that data is correctly displayed on category and product pages.
    Debug any issues that may arise during testing.
Step 7: Styling and User Experience
    Apply CSS styling to ensure a consistent and visually appealing design.
    Consider adding additional features such as search functionality, user reviews, or product ratings.
Step 8: Deployment
    When your e-commerce store is ready for production, deploy it to a hosting service or server of your choice.
    Ensure that the server and database are accessible to users.
    Remember that this is a high-level overview, and the development process may involve iterations, bug fixes, and enhancements. It's also essential to handle security aspects such as input validation, authentication, and authorization as your project matures.
